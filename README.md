# LandscapingWebsite
**DESCRIPTION** - This is a completely frontend web project that responsively displays all the website's contents. It contains easy-to-use navigation menus and built-in bootstrap components. It also includes location-based SEO.

**INSTALLATION** - You can simply clone this repository and adjust the website to better fit your needs.

**ISSUE(S)** - If a screen width is lower than 293px the site will be squished into very small sections. Devices that may have screen resolutions lower than 293px include:
- Older Device Resolutions
  - Nokia 130 (128 x 160 pixels, 1.8 inches)
  - Samsung E1200 (128 x 128 pixels, 1.52 inches)
  - Samsung E2252 (128 x 160 pixels, 2.0 inches)
  - LG A133 (128 x 128 pixels, 1.5 inches)
  - LG A275 (128 x 128 pixels, 1.45 inches)

Although these resolutions are older, it is worth noting that they may have appearance issues with the website; yet the functionality will still be in place.

**IMPORTANT** - If you decide to clone this website project, notice that there are several HTML pages in the folder that have to do with locations and different services. The HTML pages that deal with pages all have this code in there files: 

`<form action="https://formsubmit.co/<span style=“color:red;”>YourEmail</span>" method="POST" id="contactForm">`

Once you put your email in the "YourEmail" spot, FormSubmit will send you a confirmation email. Once your email is confirmed you will only receive the emails from the contact form if your site is hosted either locally or remotely.

**CREDITS** - Credit to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) for facilitating this project.
